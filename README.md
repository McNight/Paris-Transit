# Paris-Transit
An aborted and poorly written Swift project.

## Description
It's a small project that I wrote because I needed it until I realized that it (obviously) already existed.
Basically, it looks around you and lists all the nearest train stations and train times based on a JSON file from the RATP (so only for Parisians users).

It was my first Swift code (and it's quite messy sometimes) so please be indulgent :)

Have fun
